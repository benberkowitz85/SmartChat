# SmartChat

## 
PREMISE

This product offers the user access to a scholarly chat. This is helpful for both students and scholars engaged in research activities and allows them to share links to articles & information with others.

Discussion threads / chat rooms will be put to use in order for the user to compose informed responses to scientific articles, which  can be linked to that specific discussion. 

Instructors and researchers in the scholastic field can also use this application for finding social contacts within their field or area of expertise.
