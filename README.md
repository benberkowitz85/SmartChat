PREMISE

This product offers the user access to a scholarly chat. This is helpful for both students and scholars engaged in research activities and allows them to share links to articles & information with others.

Discussion threads / chat rooms will be put to use in order for the user to compose informed responses to scientific articles, which can be linked to that specific discussion. 

Instructors and researchers in the scholastic field can also use this application for finding social contacts within their field or area of expertise.


##
INSTALLATION

How to get development environment running:

Using your favorite terminal application (we recommend Git Bash) enter "npm start" from the root folder. This will start the server, so once this is achieved one will access the frontend folder and use the same command from there.

After this point, the GUI is available to you for use.

You will find a landing page with options to sign up or login. Buttons and forms are intuitive and will guide you through the process of signing up.

Once you are within our chat area, there will be options to create groups, look up chats or individual users, as well as the core function, engage in chats with others using the SmartChat app.
